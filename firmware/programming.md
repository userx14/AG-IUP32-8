# Steps for reprogramming the PIC16 microcontroller
## Preparation
Solder a 3x2 pin header to the underside of the board, the casing has enough space to accomodate this in the assembled state.
Disconnect the D-SUB-15 mixed input connector, make sure the board is not powered. Connect GND, MCLR, PGC, PGD, 5V from the PIC programmer to the board.
